# Anomaly_Detection_in_Traffic_Sensor_Data
This mini project aims at detecting anomalies in traffic sensor data using big data analytics 
and machine learning to enhance urban traffic management. Essentially, the main goal of the 
project is to design a highly scalable system that can effectively gather, store, and analyze 
large-scale traffic data to identify irregular patterns in traffic flow. This system can process 
large volumes of data coming from traffic sensors and GPS devices by using Apache Kafka 
for real-time data ingestion and distributed storage. Data preprocessing is done using Python, 
and the building and training of machine learning models for anomaly detection are 
performed using Isolation Forest and XGBoost, with PySpark used primarily for scalable 
preprocessing and data transformation.by comparing historical data with real-time inputs. 
Using Plotly, the insights gathered are visualized using interactive dashboards such as 
anomalies of traffic patterns, possible incidents, and predictive analytics. Upon finishing the 
project, the outcome is to be able to generate actionable insights that allow traffic 
management to be proactive to reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow and experience in 
commuting to cities.
